# Higher or Lower game

The project is a python version of the famous Higher or Lower game on Google but with a twist instead of higher internet searches we look at more instagram followers.

## Files in Project

The project has three files:<br>
<ul>
    <li>art.py (which has the game text graphics)</li>
    <li>game_data.py (which has the list of celebrities and their details)</li>
    <li>Higher or Lower.py (which consists the main code)</li>
</ul>

## How to change the celebrity data

Change the data in the data list of <b><b><b><b>game_data.py</b></b></b></b> file if you wanna add your own data to the existing list, add a dictionary in the list with the following keys:<br>
<ul>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>followers</li>
    <li>occupation</li>
    <li>country</li>
</ul>
